# Agent Instructions

## Rust Conventions

Apply these consistently. The pre-commit checklist at the bottom is the floor.

### Coding
- `?` for error propagation. Reserve `unwrap` / `expect` for tests and proven invariants. When `expect`ing in production, the message must explain the invariant — not just describe what would be unwrapped.
- Prefer `&str` / `&[T]` in argument position; take ownership only when storing.
- Newtype wrappers for invariant-bearing values (validated ids, paths constrained to a directory, etc.).
- `From` / `Into` for type conversions; don't write `to_*` methods when traits suffice.
- Combinators (`map`, `and_then`, `unwrap_or_else`, `?`) over `match` for short `Option` / `Result` chains. Use `match` when there's branching control flow with side effects.
- Avoid `.clone()` on hot paths. `Arc<T>` for shared immutable, `Arc<Mutex<T>>` / `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared mutable.

### `unsafe`
- Don't use `unsafe` unless it's necessary AND you've reasoned about soundness. The bar is high.
- Required cases: `std::env::set_var` / `remove_var` (Rust 2024 edition makes these `unsafe` because libc env-mutation is not threadsafe). Anything else needs a strong justification.
- Every `unsafe` block must have a `// SAFETY:` comment naming the invariant the caller is relying on. No "obvious" unsafe — write the soundness argument down. Example:

  ```rust
  // SAFETY: single-threaded test; unique env-var name; no other code touches it.
  unsafe { std::env::remove_var(&unused); }
  ```

### Testing
- Unit tests colocated as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {}` in lib files.
- Integration tests in `tests/` next to `Cargo.toml`.
- `#[tokio::test]` for async; `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` only when explicitly testing concurrent behavior.
- Mock at trait boundaries. For HTTP: `httpmock`. For time: an injected `Clock` trait.
- Determinism: sort outputs before assertion; never depend on hash iteration order.
- `expect("descriptive reason")` over `unwrap()` in tests so failure messages are self-explanatory.
- Test public behavior, not private implementation. If a private fn needs testing, surface as `pub(crate)` with a documented contract.
- Don't hold `std::sync::MutexGuard` across `.await`. Drop the guard explicitly before awaiting — `clippy::await_holding_lock` flags this.

### Generics
- `impl Trait` in argument position for single-bound, single-use parameters.
- Named generics with `where` clauses for multiple bounds, recursion, or readability.
- Avoid generic explosion: 3+ generic parameters usually indicates a missing struct or associated type.
- Prefer `Arc<dyn Trait>` over hand-rolled enum-dispatch when there are many implementors and no perf-critical specialization.
- Trait bounds: keep `Send + Sync + 'static` co-located on the trait def when the trait is only useful in async contexts.

### Error handling
- Library crates: `thiserror` with structured variants.
- Binary crates: `anyhow` with `Context::context()` for narrative.
- **Never pattern-match on error message strings.** Pattern-match on variants. If you find yourself doing `error.to_string().contains("429")`, the upstream type is throwing away structured info that should be preserved.
- Surface enough context in `Display` for debugging without leaking secrets.

### Async
- Don't hold non-async locks (`std::sync::Mutex`, `parking_lot::Mutex`) across `.await`. Drop the guard explicitly, or use `tokio::sync::Mutex` if the lock genuinely needs to span the await.
- `tokio::join!` for independent parallel work; `tokio::try_join!` when both must succeed and the first error should cancel the rest.
- Long-running spawned tasks need cancellation — channel-based or `CancellationToken`. Don't leak.
- Cross-cutting context: `tokio::task_local!`.

### Documentation
- Doc comments (`///`) on every public item.
- Include rationale (`Why:` lines) for non-obvious choices, not just descriptions of behavior.
- Don't narrate PR / issue history in code comments. Reference issues only when the comment captures a non-obvious WHY tied to that issue.

### Pre-commit checklist
1. `cargo clippy --all-targets`
2. `cargo test`
3. (Future: `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy ... -- -D warnings` once any pre-existing warnings are remediated.)
